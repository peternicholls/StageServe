# StageServe Terminal Markup Spec

This spec maps the terminal visual identity and design contract onto the current StageServe implementation. It governs concrete rendering choices in `projection_tui.go`, `projection_text.go`, `projection_shared.go`, and any guided surface that adopts the same StageServe screen grammar.

This is not the graphic-design style guide. The viewable style guide is `docs/design/terminal-visual-style-guide.md`; this file explains how that identity becomes ANSI colour, layout, glyphs, helper functions, and text/TUI parity in code.

The markup spec may evolve, but every change must preserve the visual identity guide and design contract unless those artifacts are updated first.

## Core Rendering Rules

1. **Clarity first.** Every line must earn its place. Never print a status tag, summary counter, or internal state string that a human would not naturally say aloud.
2. **Hierarchy through whitespace and weight.** Use indentation, blank lines, and font weight. Avoid boxes, decorative borders, and repeated dividers.
3. **Colour carries meaning, not decoration.** Each colour has a single consistent semantic.
4. **Commands must be copy-pasteable.** Any command shown in output must be the exact shell invocation, free of surrounding prose.
5. **TUI and plain text must carry the same information.** The TUI path may add colour and weight; it must not add or remove content.

## Shared Screen Anatomy

All StageServe screens should be composed from these layers when relevant:

1. **Surface header** — StageServe identity plus current surface.
2. **Verdict line** — first human sentence about the state.
3. **Facts or values** — visible defaults, observed facts, or current project details.
4. **Focus section** — blockers, passing checks, setup steps, recovery steps, or decisions.
5. **Secondary surface** — `More…`, details, advanced and troubleshooting, logs, or confirmation.
6. **Footer help** — only keys that matter on that screen.

Do not make the user hunt across multiple equal-weight sections for the reason the screen exists.

## Colour Palette

Lipgloss ANSI colour codes:

| Purpose | ANSI | Style var | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Success / ready | `"2"` green | `styleReady` | `✓` icons, "All clear" section header, "ready" verdict, footer command when ready |
| Warning / needs action | `"3"` yellow | `styleNeedsAction` | Issue numbers, "Needs fixing" section header, `!` icon |
| Error | `"1"` red | `styleError` | `✗` icon and verdict text when any check is in error state |
| Primary action / command | `"14"` bright cyan, bold | `styleBrightCyan` | Actual command in "To fix:" lines; footer next command when not ready |
| Supporting command / link | `"6"` cyan | `styleCyan` | Header `◆` icon; compact-mode next-step arrow `▸`; inline command refs in prose |
| Structural accent | `"15"` bright white, bold | `styleWhite` | Page title; check labels in the issues section |
| Supplementary text | `"7"` light grey | `styleMuted` | One-sentence descriptions, usually italic; secondary prose |
| De-emphasised text | `"8"` dark grey | `styleDim` | Divider lines; problem messages; compact status words in the passed table |
| Neutral bold | default bold | `styleBold` | "To fix:" label; section labels in compact mode; column headers |

Rules:

- Never use colour for decorative purposes only.
- Never introduce a new named colour without updating this table and the pattern catalog.
- Issue numbers adopt warning or error colour to match their step's severity, not a fixed yellow.
- The verdict text, not just its icon, is styled in the same colour as the icon.

## Detailed Mode Layout

```text
<blank line>
  ◆  <Title>                                      <- styleCyan icon, styleWhite bold title; gradient background spans text width only, matching footer rule width
  ──────────────────────────────────────           <- styleDim divider
<blank line>
  ✗  Not ready — N of M checks need attention.    <- styleError bold, or styleReady bold when all pass
<blank line>
── Needs fixing ────────────────────────           <- tuiSectionHeader("Needs fixing", "3")
<blank line>
  N  <Label>                                      <- issue-colour bold number, styleWhite bold label
     <one-sentence description>                   <- styleMuted italic
<blank line>
     <problem message>                            <- styleDim
     To fix:  <command>                           <- styleBold "To fix:", styleBrightCyan command
<blank line>  between issues
<blank line>  after last issue
── All clear ───────────────────────────           <- tuiSectionHeader("All clear", "2")
<blank line>
  ✓  <Label padded to 18>  <compact status>       <- styleReady check, styleBold label, styleDim status
<blank line>
  ──────────────────────────────────────           <- styleDim divider
  Fix the issues above, then run: <command>        <- styleBrightCyan command, or styleReady when ready
<blank line>
```

Section title variants:

- Issues present: `"Needs fixing"` yellow `"3"` and `"All clear"` green `"2"`.
- All passing: `"Checks passed"` green `"2"`; no `"Needs fixing"` section.

## Guided Screen Layout

Use this for bare `stage`, project setup, run/stop/logs, recovery, and any future Bubble Tea screen that is action-first instead of evidence-first.

Guided screens use a dashboard chrome area above the body. The dashboard carries four layers:

1. **Surface header:** product identity and current state such as `Running`, `Ready`, `Needs attention`, or `Doctor`.
2. **Headline:** one human sentence — a verdict, next step, or utility context — in the semantic colour that matches the state.
3. **Evidence facts:** three or four compact facts supporting the headline.
4. **Command strip:** keys relevant to the current screen.

```text
  ◆ StageServe                                      <Surface state>

  <headline: verdict or next step>
  ● <fact 1>    ● <fact 2>    ● <fact 3>
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  [<key>] <action>   [<key>] <action>   [<key>] <action>

── Key facts ───────────────────────────

  <Label padded>  <Value padded>  (<short note>)

── <Setup steps|Recovery steps|What you can do> ─────

  ▶ <default item>
    <what enter will do>

    <secondary item>
    <why someone would choose it>

  <context-specific footer help>
```

Rules:

- The dashboard headline is the most prominent line after the surface header. Use semantic colour matching the state: green for ready, yellow for attention, red for errors.
- Evidence facts wrap onto additional lines in narrow terminals rather than truncating important values.
- Show the value StageServe will use before the action that commits to it.
- Keep the highlighted default first and low-risk.
- Use one dominant focus section. Do not show `Needs fixing`, `Setup steps`, and `What you can do` at equal visual weight on the same screen unless the screen truly needs all three.
- `More…` is a secondary entry, not a footer-only hidden shortcut.

## Work Checklist Rows

Use work checklists for machine setup and ordered recovery work.

```text
  ✓  Docker Desktop                     ready
  ▶  Local DNS for .develop             needs your approval
     StageServe will add a small file so your browser can open local project URLs.
     Enter: preview the change and confirm it.
```

Rules:

- One step may be active at a time.
- The active step gets description and next-action copy.
- Status words are short and human-readable.
- The checklist order communicates the tool-owned path.

## Decision List Rows

Use decision lists for user-goal choices.

```text
▶ Run this project
    Start the project and open it in your browser.

  Edit project settings
    Change site name, web folder, or domain suffix first.

  More…
    Show direct commands, plain text output, and advanced detail.
```

Rules:

- The description is the contract for what pressing `enter` will do.
- Do not use vague labels like `Continue` when the concrete action can be named.
- Do not mix exact shell commands inline with the decision list; keep them in `More…` or report remediation.

## Confirmation Layout

```text
<Title>
<blank line>
  <what StageServe will change>
  <what StageServe will not change>
  <path/value/URL>
<blank line>
  ▶ <Yes label>    <No label>
<blank line>
  ←/→ choose • enter confirm • esc cancel
```

Rules:

- Show the concrete target path, URL, or project name.
- Confirmations for destructive or state-changing actions are required.
- Rare destructive actions may default to the non-destructive option.

## More Panel Layout

`More…` groups power-user material and keeps the main screen focused.

It should contain:

- direct command equivalents
- plain-text fallback entry
- advanced and troubleshooting path
- settings-file or hidden working-folder path when relevant

Do not expose implementation detail as a primary action when it can live in `More…`.

## Logs View

Logs preserve the existing log stream format. The view should add only:

- clear project identity
- a stable exit hint
- return-to-screen consistency

Do not reformat logs into decorative cards or tables.

## Footer Help

Footer hints are contextual.

- Show only keys that matter on that screen.
- Avoid footers that teach the screen through hidden shortcuts alone.
- Essential power-user paths should be reachable through `More…` even if a shortcut also exists.

## Compact Mode Layout

Used by `stage init` and inline readiness checks. Compact mode does not show descriptions or a footer.

```text
✓  <Label>                                        <- only icon and label for passing checks
!  <Label>                                        <- icon, label, message, and "Next:" for failing checks
   <problem message>                              <- styleDim
   Next:  <command>                               <- styleBold "Next:", styleCyan command

▸  <next step>                                    <- styleCyan arrow and styleBold text
```

Rules:

- Only print message and remediation rows for checks that are not `StatusReady`.
- Print at most one next-step line at the bottom.

## Section Headers

`tuiSectionHeader(title, colorCode)` is the canonical function.

Structure: dim `"── "` plus coloured bold title plus dim trailing line, totalling about 40 visible columns.

- Always use `tuiSectionHeader` in the TUI path.
- Always use `sectionHeader` in the plain-text path.
- Do not create freeform section headers inline in render functions.

## Column Alignment

The passed-checks table must align. Apply `fmt.Sprintf("%-18s", label)` to the raw string before passing it to `styleBold.Render(...)`. ANSI escape codes inflate byte counts and break `%-Ns` format verbs.

```go
paddedLabel := fmt.Sprintf("%-18s", s.Label)
fmt.Fprintf(w, "  %s  %s  %s\n", styleReady.Render("✓"), styleBold.Render(paddedLabel), styleDim.Render(compactMessage(s)))
```

If the column width changes, update this spec and the code together.

## Compact Status Words

`compactMessage(s StepResult)` in `projection_shared.go` controls the short status string for each check ID.

| Check ID | Compact word |
|---|---|
| `state.dir` | `exists` |
| `port.80`, `port.443` | `available` |
| `mkcert.binary` | `installed` |
| `dns.resolver` ready | `configured` |
| anything else | `s.Message` verbatim |

When adding a new check, add its compact word here and in `compactMessage`.

## Check Descriptions

`checkDescription(id string)` in `projection_shared.go` maps a step ID to one italic sentence explaining why the check matters. This line appears beneath the check label in the issues section only.

Format: plain statement of fact ending with a full stop. No "Note:", no imperative, no "you must".

| ID | Description |
|---|---|
| `docker.binary` | `Docker CLI — the command-line tool used to manage containers.` |
| `docker.daemon` | `The Docker daemon must be running before any container can start.` |
| `state.dir` | `Stores StageServe runtime data: ports, certs, project registry.` |
| `port.80` | `Port 80 must be free for the local HTTP gateway to bind to it.` |
| `port.443` | `Port 443 must be free for the local HTTPS gateway to bind to it.` |
| `dns.resolver` | `Routes *.test domains to your stack — needs dnsmasq configured.` |
| `mkcert.binary` | `Creates trusted local HTTPS certificates without browser warnings.` |

When adding a new check, add its description here and in `checkDescription`.

## Remediation Strings

Remediation values stored on `StepResult.Remediation` must be:

- The exact shell command only.
- No `"Run: "` prefix.
- No trailing explanation in parentheses.
- No placeholder text unless the command itself requires a literal placeholder already established by the command UX.

`cleanRemediation()` strips legacy `"Run: "` and `"run: "` prefixes automatically, but new code should not add them.

The rendered label is always `"To fix:"` in detailed mode or `"Next:"` in compact mode.

## Things Never To Print

- Internal status strings: `needs_action`, `StatusNeedsAction`, `OverallReady`, exit codes in prose.
- Summary counters: `"Summary: N ready, N need attention, N errors"`.
- `(s)` pluralisation; use `plural(n, sing, plur string)` from `projection_shared.go`.
- Step ID tags such as `[docker.binary]` or `[Needs action]`.
- `"Result: Needs action (exit 1)"` or any machine-facing status field.
- Box borders such as `╭─╮`, `│`, `╰─╯`.

## Updating This Spec

When changing output layout, colour use, or shared helper behaviour:

1. Update this spec in the same change.
2. Update the pattern catalog if the change creates or revises a reusable pattern.
3. Update "Check descriptions" or "Compact status words" if adding a new check.
4. Add a colour palette row before adding a new named style variable.
5. Run `go test ./core/onboarding ./cmd/stage/commands` for onboarding and command output changes.
