# Original Intentions, Research, And Decisions

## Purpose

This document pulls together the product intention, specification research, and decisions found in spec 004, spec 005, the project constitution, and the current developer guidance for spec 007.

## Reconciliation Note

This document is historical and interpretive, but several points are now fully decided by spec 007 rather than left as inference:

- spec 004's "TUI out of scope" note is treated as a sequencing boundary, not a product decision against guided TUI
- spec 005's `stage setup --tui` handoff is superseded by bare `stage` as the interactive entrypoint
- spec 005's narrower onboarding TUI projection is superseded by a root guided TUI model
- plain-language easy-mode labels supersede raw command words as the first-level guided vocabulary

The central product intention is not "a Docker CLI with some helper commands". The intended first-level experience is a simple guided StageServe surface that helps a normal user install, set up the machine, set up a project, run it, stop it, inspect it, and recover from problems without needing to understand the Docker implementation.

Power users should still be able to use finer-grained command calls and inspect hidden artifacts, but those controls should sit behind the simple first-level path.

## Primary Product Intention

The intended operator model is:

- `stage` on its own opens the simple guided path.
- The guided path covers first install handoff, machine setup, per-project setup, running, stopping, status, logs, and recovery.
- The user configures StageServe through `.env.stageserve` files only.
- Project `.env` remains application-owned.
- Docker and compose details are implementation internals, not normal project-directory or command-line concepts.
- Runtime artifacts remain hidden in StageServe-owned directories, mainly `.stageserve-state`, but remain inspectable and editable by power users.
- A primary "simple" user is never left at a dead end; every non-ready state should have a specific next action.
- A power user can bypass the guided path with direct commands such as `stage up`, `stage setup --json`, `stage init --force`, `stage status`, and `stage down --all`.
- Easy-mode language should match the way the user describes their goal. For example, "add this project to StageServe" and "remove this project from StageServe" are clearer first-level labels than `attach` and `detach`; the command names remain available for power users.

This matches the constitution:

- "Ease Of Use Is A Product Requirement": the primary operator experience must stay simple enough to use from memory.
- "Reliability Must Be Boring And Predictable": repeated runs and config precedence must be deterministic and visible.
- "Robustness Must Hold Under Real Failure": failures must be actionable through status, logs, health checks, or recovery instructions.
- "Remove Pinch Points And User Friction": new steps, prompts, and stateful exceptions must remove recurring pain rather than move it elsewhere.

## Spec 004 Decisions

Spec 004, "Workflow And Lifecycle Hardening", focused on making the existing lifecycle trustworthy. Its main decisions were:

- Keep one lifecycle bootstrap phase only.
- Run the bootstrap phase after StageServe-owned readiness succeeds.
- Run the bootstrap command inside the `apache` service container.
- Source `STAGESERVE_POST_UP_COMMAND` only from the project-root `.env.stageserve`.
- Treat bootstrap failure as a named lifecycle failure, not as a gateway, DNS, Docker, or generic app failure.
- Roll back the current project runtime on bootstrap failure, including operator cancellation.
- Use `.env.stageserve` as the only supported stack-owned defaults filename.
- Keep project `.env` application-owned.
- Use deterministic StageServe-owned runtime names such as `stage-<slug>` for project-scoped resources.
- Keep shared routing StageServe-managed and distinguish it from project-scoped runtime resources.
- Require real-daemon validation of representative single-project and multi-project workflows.

Spec 004 explicitly put "TUI / GUI surface changes" out of scope. That was a planning boundary, not a rejection of the original product intention. It meant the lifecycle had to be hardened before the guided surface could be completed.

## Spec 005 Research And Decisions

Spec 005, "Installer, Onboarding, And Environment Readiness", researched comparable installer and onboarding patterns. The research favored:

- One recommended install path per supported OS.
- Binary integrity verification for direct installs.
- A guided setup sequence with deterministic checkpoints.
- Idempotent setup that can be safely rerun.
- Machine-readable output for automation.
- Explicit privilege boundaries.
- Clear support matrix and compatibility guidance.
- A project initializer to write `.env.stageserve` safely.
- A diagnostics command for day-2 drift.

The concrete decisions in spec 005 were:

- Add `stage setup` for machine readiness and first-run checks.
- Add `stage init` for project-local `.env.stageserve` creation.
- Add `stage doctor` for read-only diagnostics.
- Add text, JSON, and TUI output modes for onboarding commands.
- Use normalized step statuses: `ready`, `needs_action`, and `error`.
- Use stable exit semantics: 0 ready, 1 needs action, 2 error, 3 unsupported OS.
- Keep privileged setup actions explicit and bounded.
- Handoff from the installer to `stage setup --tui` when interactive, or print next steps otherwise.

Spec 005 reintroduced the TUI idea, but in a narrower guise than the original intention: the TUI became an output projection for `setup`, `doctor`, and `init`, not the primary first-level product surface exposed by plain `stage`.

## Reconciled Intent For Spec 007

Spec 007 should treat specs 004 and 005 as useful foundations, not as the final product shape.

The target product model should be:

- Bare `stage` opens a guided TUI command center.
- The guided TUI is the normal first-level path for non-power users.
- The TUI routes users through setup, init, up, status, logs, down, doctor, and recovery.
- The TUI uses the same deep modules and command contracts as direct CLI commands.
- Direct subcommands remain available for power users and automation.
- All user-editable config is expressed through `.env.stageserve`.
- Docker concepts are hidden from normal project-facing language unless the user opens an advanced/troubleshooting path.
- Hidden runtime artifacts stay available for inspection, but the simple path never requires manual editing of those artifacts.
- The guided surface should describe actions in plain language first, then provide the direct command equivalent on request.
