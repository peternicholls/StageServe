# Data Model: Workflow And Lifecycle Hardening

## Bootstrap Contract

- Purpose: Represents the project-scoped declaration of whether StageServe runs a post-up bootstrap command and how that command participates in lifecycle success or failure.
- Fields:
  - `source`: fixed to project-root `.env.stageserve` (silently ignored if set via shell env, stack-home `.env.stageserve`, or project `.env`)
  - `command`: string value from `STAGESERVE_POST_UP_COMMAND`
  - `phase`: fixed to `post-up`
  - `execution_target`: fixed to the `apache` service container
  - `working_directory`: fixed to the container site root (`/home/sites/<project-slug>`) via the orchestrator's docker exec invocation
  - `failure_mode`: fixed to rollback
  - `failure_step_name`: lifecycle step label `post-up-hook` used in operator-visible errors
  - `cancellation_behavior`: operator `Ctrl-C` during bootstrap aborts the hook and triggers rollback under the same step name
- Relationships:
  - Belongs to one project runtime.
  - Depends on StageServe-owned readiness succeeding first.
  - Produces either a successful post-bootstrap runtime or a rollback outcome.
- Validation rules:
  - The contract must not be sourced from stack-wide config.
  - Absence of a bootstrap command must not trigger implicit framework-specific behavior.
  - Failure must be classified separately from gateway, DNS, and container-health failures.

## Stack Defaults Contract

- Purpose: Represents stack-owned defaults that apply across projects without taking ownership of project application config.
- Fields:
  - `file_name`: `.env.stageserve`
  - `scope`: location-defined: stack-home defaults or project-local overrides
  - `precedence_rank`: below shell environment, above built-in defaults
  - `allowed_keys`: stack runtime defaults such as shared gateway, DNS, and runtime defaults
- Relationships:
  - Feeds the config loader.
  - Must remain distinct from project `.env` and from machine-generated envfiles under `.stageserve-state/envfiles/`.
- Validation rules:
  - The file must be the only stack-owned defaults file in the supported contract.
  - It must not be documented as application config.

## Runtime Naming Contract

- Purpose: Represents the names StageServe derives for project-scoped runtime resources.
- Fields:
  - `project_prefix`: `stage-`
  - `compose_project_name`: `stage-<slug>` by default (config field `ComposeProjectName`)
  - `web_network_alias`: `stage-<slug>-web` by default (config field `WebNetworkAlias`)
  - `runtime_network`: `<compose-project>-runtime` (derived; config field `RuntimeNetwork`)
  - `database_volume`: `<compose-project>-db-data` (derived; config field `DatabaseVolume`)
- Shared-resource fields (separate naming rule, not project-scoped):
  - `shared_compose_project`: `stage-shared`
  - `shared_network`: `stage-shared`
  - `gateway_service_alias`: `stage-gateway`
- Relationships:
  - Derived from the project slug and config loader defaults.
  - Used by compose invocations, gateway upstream routing, Docker label lookup, and operator-facing status output.
- Validation rules:
  - Every project-scoped default field listed above must use the `stage-` prefix consistently.
  - Shared-resource fields must stay aligned with the same `stage-` prefix family and must remain distinguishable from per-project names by their fixed `shared` / `gateway` suffixes.

## Validation Scenario

- Purpose: Represents a documented real-world workflow used to prove lifecycle behavior.
- Fields:
  - `scenario_type`: `single-project` or `multi-project`
  - `projects_under_test`: list of representative repos or fixtures
  - `commands`: ordered lifecycle commands under test
  - `checks`: DNS, gateway, runtime env, database, bootstrap, status, teardown, rollback
  - `expected_outcomes`: observable operator-visible results for each check
  - `evidence`: test notes, command output summary, or recorded validation artifact
- Relationships:
  - Exercises the bootstrap contract and runtime naming contract together.
  - Feeds quickstart validation and plan completion criteria.
- Validation rules:
  - At least one scenario must cover bootstrap success.
  - At least one scenario must cover bootstrap failure and rollback.
  - At least one scenario must cover attached multi-project routing.

## Failure Classification

- Purpose: Represents the operator-facing boundary between StageServe infrastructure failures and application-owned failures.
- Fields:
  - `class`: gateway, DNS, readiness, bootstrap (StageServe lifecycle classes); `application-follow-up` is a documentation-only label used in operator guidance and is never emitted by StageServe lifecycle code
  - `owner`: StageServe or application
  - `recovery_path`: rerun, inspect logs, fix app, or reroute through documented workflow
  - `status_effect`: whether runtime remains up or is rolled back
- Relationships:
  - Attached to lifecycle step errors and validation notes.
  - Determines how docs and status output explain what failed.
- Validation rules:
  - Bootstrap failure must be a StageServe lifecycle class with rollback.
  - Application route defects after readiness must not be misreported as gateway or DNS failures.
