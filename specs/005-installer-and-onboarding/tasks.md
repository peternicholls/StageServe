# Tasks: Installer, Onboarding, And Environment Readiness

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-installer-and-onboarding/`
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md` (required), `spec.md` (required), `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`

**Tests**: Include focused automated tests because the feature spec defines mandatory user-story test criteria and stable machine contracts. Keep behavioral tests behind `core/onboarding` seams whenever possible; reserve command-package tests for adapter wiring, flag handling, and top-level contract compliance.

**TDD Rule**: For every implementation task in this file, first add or extend the narrowest failing test that proves the target behavior, then implement the minimum code to pass, then refactor locally while staying green. Do not front-load all tests for a story before writing code.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each story can be implemented and verified independently, but work inside each story should stay concept-local: deepen runtime, readiness, ownership, and projection modules before spreading behavior across command files.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Establish command scaffolding and shared onboarding artifacts.

- [x] T001 Add onboarding command registrations in `cmd/stacklane/commands/root.go`.
- [x] T002 Create setup command scaffold in `cmd/stacklane/commands/setup.go`.
- [x] T003 Create doctor command scaffold in `cmd/stacklane/commands/doctor.go`.
- [x] T004 Create init command scaffold in `cmd/stacklane/commands/init.go`.
- [x] T005 Add Bubble Tea and Huh dependencies in `go.mod`.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Build the deep modules that command adapters and tests will depend on.

**CRITICAL**: Complete this phase before user-story implementation.

- [x] T006 Implement shared onboarding types and result envelope in `core/onboarding/types.go`.
- [x] T007 Implement shared onboarding runtime and exit-code reduction in `core/onboarding/runtime.go`.
- [x] T008 [P] Implement text projection adapter in `core/onboarding/projection_text.go`.

## Phase 5: User Story 4 - Initialize A Project For StageServe (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Deliver `stage init` with guided defaults, strict docroot validation, and safe write semantics.

**Independent Test**: In a project without `.env.stageserve`, run `stage init` and verify minimal file output, validation behavior, and next-step guidance.

### Tests for User Story 4

- [x] T033 [P] [US4] Add init command-adapter and contract tests in `cmd/stacklane/commands/init_test.go`.
- [x] T034 [P] [US4] Add project-env ownership tests in `core/onboarding/project_env_test.go`.

### Implementation for User Story 4

Execute US4 in red-green-refactor slices: start with one failing ownership or validation test, pass it in `core/onboarding/project_env.go`, then layer the adapter behavior afterward.

## Phase 6: User Story 3 - Diagnose Drift And Recover Quickly (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Deliver `stage doctor` read-only diagnostics with targeted recovery guidance and JSON parity.

**Independent Test**: Break one dependency (for example resolver file drift), run `stage doctor`, and verify precise detection plus recovery command.

### Tests for User Story 3

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- Setup (Phase 1) has no dependencies.
- Foundational (Phase 2) depends on Setup and blocks all story work.
- User stories (Phases 3-6) depend on Foundational completion.
- Polish (Phase 7) depends on completion of all targeted user stories.

### User Story Dependencies

- US1 (Install): starts after Foundational; no dependency on other stories.
- US2 (Setup): starts after Foundational; depends on the shared runtime and machine-readiness seams, not on US1 implementation details.
- US4 (Init): starts after Foundational; depends on the shared project-env ownership seam and remains independently testable.
- US3 (Doctor): starts after Foundational; depends on the shared runtime and machine-readiness seams and remains independently testable.

### Recommended Delivery Order

1. US1 (MVP entrypoint)
2. US2 (first-run readiness)
3. US4 (project onboarding)
4. US3 (day-2 diagnostics)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### User Story 1

- T015 and T016 can run in parallel.
- T015/T016 should be used to open the first red cycle before T017-T020.
- T017-T020 are sequential in `install.sh` and should each be driven by the next failing behavior test.
- T021 can run in parallel with T022.

### User Story 2

- T023 and T024 can run in parallel.
- T023/T024 should open the first red cycle before T025-T032.
- T027 and T028 can run in parallel.
- T029 and T030 depend on the runtime and readiness seams being in place.

### User Story 4

- T033 and T034 can run in parallel.
- T033/T034 should open the first red cycle before T035-T040.
- T036 and T038 are the core ownership work and should finish before T039.
- T037 and T040 depend on the ownership seam.

### User Story 3

- T041 and T042 can run in parallel.
- T041/T042 should open the first red cycle before T043-T047.
- T044 and T045 can run in parallel after T043.
- T046 and T047 complete the story-specific policy and projection work.

## Implementation Strategy

## TDD Tracer Bullet Order

Before broad story work, use this concrete first-slice order:

1. T014 with `TestReduceExitCode_PrefersUnsupportedOS` in `core/onboarding/runtime_test.go`.
2. T014 with `TestOverallStatus_NeedsActionWithoutError` in `core/onboarding/runtime_test.go`.
3. T024 with `TestDockerBinaryCheck_MissingBinary` in `core/onboarding/machine_readiness_test.go`.
4. T023 with `TestSetup_NonInteractiveMissingSuffix` in `cmd/stacklane/commands/setup_test.go` or the equivalent runtime-level behavior test.
5. T034 with `TestValidateProjectEnv_RejectsDocrootOutsideProjectRoot` in `core/onboarding/project_env_test.go`.
6. T041 or T042 with `TestDoctor_UnhealthyGateway` in the deepest seam that can prove the behavior cleanly.

If a slice exposes a missing lower-level seam, add that seam and keep the test at the deepest public interface that still proves the same behavior.

### MVP First

1. Complete Phase 1 and Phase 2.
2. Complete Phase 3 (US1) only.
3. Validate canonical install success on clean macOS machine.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Deliver US1 for deterministic installation.
2. Deliver US2 for machine setup and readiness.
3. Deliver US4 for project bootstrap onboarding.
4. Deliver US3 for drift diagnostics and recovery.
5. Complete polish and run focused validation.

### Team Parallelization

1. One engineer completes Setup + Foundational phases.
2. Then split story work in parallel:
	- Engineer A: US2
	- Engineer B: US4
	- Engineer C: US3
3. Rejoin for Phase 7 parity and final validation.

## Notes

- `[P]` marks tasks that can execute concurrently without file conflicts.
- `[USx]` labels map each task to one user story for traceability.
- Keep each story independently runnable and verifiable at its checkpoint.
- Preserve shared JSON and status semantics across text, TUI, and JSON outputs.
