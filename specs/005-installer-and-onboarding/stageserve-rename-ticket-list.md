# Tickets: StageServe Rename And stage Command Cutover

**Objective**: Execute a controlled rename from Stacklane to StageServe with CLI command `stage`, while preserving runtime safety and minimizing operator surprise.

**Scope baseline**:
- Project identity: StageServe
- Primary command: `stage`
- Current state: pre-release
- Default recommendation: keep runtime/state internals (`STAGESERVE_*`, `.env.stageserve`, `.stageserve-state`, `stage-*`) stable unless explicitly changed by a dedicated migration ticket

**Out of scope unless explicitly added**:
- Runtime architecture changes unrelated to naming
- Compose topology changes
- Behavior changes to setup/init/doctor flows

**Definition of done**:
- `stage` is the documented and installed command everywhere
- Validation matrix passes on clean and dirty machines
- Rollback path is tested and documented
- No stale command references remain in active docs/specs

## Execution Order

1. Phase 0: Governance and contract lock.
2. Phase 1: Binary and command surface.
3. Phase 2: Compatibility shim (if enabled).
4. Phase 3: Docs/spec alignment.
5. Phase 4: CI/CD and release assets.
6. Phase 5: Weird edge-case hardening.
7. Phase 6: Verification matrix.
8. Phase 7: Release and closure.

## Parallelization Guidance

- Can run in parallel:
1. RENAME-005 and RENAME-008 after RENAME-003/004.
2. RENAME-011 and RENAME-012 after RENAME-003.
3. RENAME-014/015/016 once core rename is in place.

- Keep sequential:
1. RENAME-001 before all implementation tickets.
2. RENAME-019 before RENAME-020.
3. RENAME-023 before RENAME-024.

## Risk Register Snapshot

- High risk: stale PATH entries causing users to run old binary unexpectedly.
- High risk: deprecation text leaking into JSON stdout during shim forwarding.
- Medium risk: stale shell completion caches producing misleading command hints.
- Medium risk: CI cache key reuse masking artifact/path mistakes.
- Medium risk: docs drift where old command appears in less-visible pages.
