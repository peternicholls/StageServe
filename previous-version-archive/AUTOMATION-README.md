# 🚀 Stacklane Manager - macOS Automation

This automation provides experimental GUI interfaces for Stacklane on macOS. The CLI is the primary interface for the implemented runtime contract.

## 📱 What You Get

### 1. **Stacklane Manager.app** 
- **Location**: `/Users/peternicholls/docker/20i-stack/20i Stack Manager.app`
- **Usage**: Double-click to launch
- **Features**: 
  - 🚀 Start Stack (with folder picker and settings dialog)
  - 🛑 Stop Stack (with project selector)
  - 📊 View Status (shows running containers)
  - 📋 View Logs (follow logs in Terminal)

### 2. **Services Menu Integration**
- **Access**: Right-click anywhere → Services → "Stacklane Manager"
- **Usage**: Available system-wide in any application
- **Same features** as the standalone app

## 🎯 How It Works

### Starting a Stack:
1. **Select Project Folder**: Choose your project directory
2. **Optional Settings**: Set custom environment variables (e.g., `HOST_PORT=8080`)
3. **Auto-Detection**: Project name is automatically detected from folder name
4. **Terminal Launch**: Opens Terminal and runs the docker compose commands

### Smart Features:
- ✅ **Auto-detects running projects** for stop and logs operations
- ✅ **Proper environment isolation** using `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`
- ✅ **Visual feedback** with notifications and dialogs
- ✅ **Terminal integration** for full command visibility
- ⚠️ **CLI leads GUI** for the shared gateway, attach, detach, retained state, and planned hostname reporting

## 🛠 Installation

The automation is already set up! Here's what was installed:

```bash
# Standalone App (ready to use)
~/docker/20i-stack/20i Stack Manager.app

# Services Menu (system-wide access)
~/Library/Services/20i Stack Manager.workflow
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Double-click** `20i Stack Manager.app`
2. **Choose "🚀 Start Stack"**
3. **Select your project folder**
4. **Optionally configure settings** (or just click "Skip")
5. **Watch Terminal** as your stack starts
6. **Access your site** at the URL printed in Terminal. The CLI now uses the shared gateway port rather than a per-project web port.

If you edit this repository in one location and run the live stack from another, sync the changes into the deployed copy first. The common setup here is editing in `/Users/peternicholls/Dev/20i-stack` and launching from `/Users/peternicholls/docker/20i-stack`.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Services Menu**: Access from any app via right-click → Services
- **Multiple Projects**: Prefer the CLI for concurrent project workflows until GUI parity lands
- **Custom Ports**: The CLI owns the shared gateway web ports; GUI port overrides still follow the older direct-compose flow
- **Logs**: Use "📋 View Logs" to debug issues
- **Quick Stop**: The stop dialog shows only running projects

## 🔧 Environment Variables

You can set these in the settings dialog:

```bash
HOST_PORT=8080          # Custom web port
MYSQL_PORT=3307         # Custom database port  
PMA_PORT=8082          # Custom phpMyAdmin port
MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb    # Custom database name
```

## 🎨 Example Workflow

1. **Start a project**:
   - Start stack → Select `/path/to/project-a` → site becomes available through the shared gateway at `project-a.test`

2. **Add a concurrent project**:
   - The GUI does not yet expose `stacklane --attach`. Use the CLI: `cd /path/to/project-b && stacklane --attach`
   - Both sites then run simultaneously. The GUI's stop and start actions operate on one project at a time and do not disrupt the other.

3. **Debug Issues**:
   - View Status → See all containers
   - View Logs → Follow real-time logs for a selected project

For full multi-project workflows, concurrent attach/detach, and global teardown see [docs/migration.md](docs/migration.md) and use `stacklane` directly.

Use the automation as a convenience layer, not the source of truth for the Stacklane runtime contract.
