# Migration Guide: 20i Commands to Stacklane

This guide covers the transition from the original localhost-centric single-project workflow and `20i-*` commands to Stacklane and the shared-gateway multi-project model.

## What Changed

The original stack was built around a simple model: one project at a time, accessed through `localhost`. The shared-gateway model introduces persistent infrastructure that lives outside any one project, enabling multiple projects to run concurrently at stable local hostnames without port juggling.

| Concept | Old model | New model |
|---|---|---|
| Access URL | `http://localhost` or `http://localhost:8080` | `http://project-name.test` |
| Multiple projects | Stop one, start another | Attach both concurrently |
| Gateway ownership | Per-project compose file published to host | Shared `docker-compose.shared.yml` |
| DNS | `/etc/hosts` edit or none | `dnsmasq` + `/etc/resolver/test` (one-time) |
| Project identity | `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` only | Slug, hostname, state file, registry |
| State tracking | None (Docker state only) | `.20i-state/` per-project env files + registry snapshot |

## Old Workflow

```bash
# Basic docker compose
cd /path/to/project
docker compose -p myproject up -d
# visit http://localhost
docker compose -p myproject down

# Or using older 20i scripts
cd /path/to/project
20i-up   # started containers, published web port to localhost
20i-down # stopped containers
```

Switching to a second project meant stopping the first.

## New Workflow

### One-time per-machine setup

```bash
stacklane --dns-setup
```

This installs Homebrew `dnsmasq`, configures it to resolve `*.test` to `127.0.0.1`, and writes `/etc/resolver/test`. The last step may require `sudo`; the command prints the exact copy-paste if so. Run once — it persists across reboots.

If you switch to `.dev`, the same command also generates a local wildcard TLS certificate. Local `.dev` uses HTTPS on port `8443` by default, which avoids common `443` conflicts while keeping the URL stable.

### Normal per-project usage

```bash
cd /path/to/project
stacklane --up            # shared gateway starts if not running; project registers at project-name.test
# visit http://project-name.test
stacklane --status        # shows hostname, container health, gateway and DNS state
stacklane --down          # stops the project runtime; retains its state record
```

Legacy `20i-*` wrappers are deprecated and only retained for the migration window. They still forward for now, but Stacklane is the primary workflow, the documented path, and the only interface that should be used in new scripts or docs.

### Running two projects concurrently

```bash
cd /path/to/project-a
stacklane --up            # http://project-a.test is live

cd /path/to/project-b
stacklane --attach        # http://project-b.test starts alongside project-a.test

stacklane --status        # both projects shown
```

`stacklane --attach` is the explicit multi-project command. `stacklane --up` in a new repo also attaches if the shared layer is already running.

### Teardown

```bash
# Stop one project and retain its state record
stacklane --down

# Stop one project and remove its state record entirely
stacklane --detach

# Stop all projects and clear all state
stacklane --down --all
```

## Command Mapping

| Old command | Stacklane equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `docker compose up -d` | `stacklane --up` | Also starts shared gateway, registers hostname |
| `docker compose down` | `stacklane --down` | Project-scoped; retains record by default |
| `docker compose logs -f` | `stacklane --logs` | Project-aware; use `--project` to switch scope |
| `docker compose ps` | `stacklane --status` | Now shows gateway, DNS, hostnames, and drift |
| Stop A, then start B | `stacklane --attach` from project B | Both run concurrently |
| _(no equivalent)_ | `stacklane --detach` | Removes project record and routing |
| _(no equivalent)_ | `stacklane --down --all` | Global teardown |
| _(no equivalent)_ | `stacklane --dns-setup` | One-time local DNS bootstrap |

Retained compatibility wrappers:

These wrappers are deprecated and scheduled to be dropped in a future update once the migration window closes.

| Legacy wrapper | Forwards to |
|---|---|
| `20i-up` | `stacklane --up` |
| `20i-attach` | `stacklane --attach` |
| `20i-down` | `stacklane --down` |
| `20i-detach` | `stacklane --detach` |
| `20i-status` | `stacklane --status` |
| `20i-logs` | `stacklane --logs` |
| `20i-dns-setup` | `stacklane --dns-setup` |

## Config Migration

Per-project `.env` files from the old workflow are still read. The canonical per-project config file is now `.20i-local`:

```bash
# Old: .env in project root (still resolved but not preferred)
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=mysite
HOST_PORT=8080
MYSQL_DATABASE=mysite_db

# New: .20i-local (preferred)
export SITE_NAME=mysite
export DOCROOT=public_html
export PHP_VERSION=8.4
export MYSQL_DATABASE=mysite_db
```

`HOST_PORT` is still resolved and honoured, but the new model routes all web traffic through the shared gateway rather than publishing a direct host port. Setting a specific `HOST_PORT` is rarely needed unless you want the phpMyAdmin or database ports to land on a particular number.

## Hostname Strategy

The hostname defaults to the project folder name. For a repo at `/path/to/my-project` the hostname is `my-project.test`.

Override in `.20i-local`:

```bash
export SITE_NAME=brand-name      # becomes brand-name.test
export SITE_HOSTNAME=exact.test  # full override, no suffix appended
```

## What Stays the Same

- Runtime behavior, config precedence, and state isolation are unchanged under `stacklane`.
- Config resolution order (CLI flags → `.20i-local` → environment → `.env` → defaults) is unchanged.
- PHP version, database credentials, and document root overrides all work as before.
- The `public_html` default document root fallback is unchanged.
- The GUI layer (`20i Stack Manager.app` and the Services menu workflow) still starts and stops a project. It does not yet expose attach, detach, or per-project hostname reporting. GUI assets and documentation have been moved to `previous-version-archive/GUI-HELP.md`.

## Repository Rename vs Local Folder Rename

- A GitHub repository rename and your local checkout folder name are separate changes.
- The GitHub repository is now named `StackLane`, but existing local clones do not rename themselves.
- If you want your local stack folder to be named `stacklane`, rename that directory manually and then update `STACK_HOME`, shell aliases, launchers, and any deployment copy that still points at `~/docker/20i-stack`.

## Wordfence / `.user.ini` Note

WordPress sites cloned from live often have a hardcoded host path in `public_html/.user.ini`:

```
auto_prepend_file = '/absolute/host/path/wordfence-waf.php'
```

Change this to the container path before starting:

```
auto_prepend_file = '/var/www/site/wordfence-waf.php'
```

Then restart: `docker restart <project>-apache-1`

This was true in the old model and remains true in the new one.

## Known Deferred Items

- **Full GUI parity**: the GUI trails the CLI.
- **Windows / Linux DNS**: the `dnsmasq` bootstrap is macOS-only for now.

## Clean-Machine Bootstrap

Requirements: macOS, Docker Desktop, Homebrew.

```bash
# 1. Clone or copy the stack
# Note: the GitHub repository is named StackLane; the local folder remains ~/docker/20i-stack
# until you choose to rename it and update STACK_HOME accordingly.
git clone https://github.com/peternicholls/StackLane.git ~/docker/20i-stack

# 2. Add stack commands to your path — add to ~/.zshrc and reload
echo 'export STACK_HOME="$HOME/docker/20i-stack"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$STACK_HOME:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# 3. Bootstrap local DNS (once per machine)
stacklane --dns-setup

# 4. Start your first project
cd /path/to/your-project
stacklane --up
```

If `stacklane --dns-setup` requires elevated privileges it prints the exact `sudo` command to run to finish the resolver file installation. After that single manual step everything resolves automatically.
