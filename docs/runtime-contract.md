# StageServe Runtime Contract

This document locks the StageServe command semantics and state model.

## Goals

- Preserve an easy shell-first workflow.
- Make repeated command runs reliable and predictable.
- Keep the stack robust under partial failure and stale state.
- Make `up`, `attach`, `down`, and status behavior explicit.
- Keep the active command surface focused on `stage <subcommand>`.

## Command Behavior

### `stage`

- With no subcommand, collects cheap local context and opens the guided shell in an interactive terminal without mutating project config or state.
- In non-interactive output, prints the same plain text guidance and exits without prompting.
- `--notui`, `--cli`, and `STAGESERVE_NO_TUI=1` force the same plain text fallback for bare `stage`.
- `--help`, `-h`, `--version`, and direct subcommands bypass guided routing and keep their normal Cobra behavior.
- The guided plan uses the same config precedence as direct commands and keeps direct command equivalents visible.

### `stage up`

- Works from a project root.
- Resolves StageServe config from project-root `.env.stageserve`, shell environment, stack-wide `.env.stageserve`, and CLI flags while leaving project `.env` application-owned.
- Requires `STAGESERVE_STACK` to resolve to a supported stack kind. Today that means `20i`.
- If project-root `.env.stageserve` is missing, assumes defaults for the current run and writes a starter project file for later edits.
- Derives a project slug from the folder name by default.
- Plans a hostname of `<slug>.test` unless overridden.
- Ensures shared routing is available, reuses it when already healthy, and repairs it when missing.
- Starts the current Docker compose project.
- Captures the live runtime container identity.
- Writes a project state file, refreshes the stack registry, and marks the project as `attached`.
- Refreshes the shared hostname-aware route set from the registry.

### `stage attach`

- Uses the same runtime resolution as `stage up`.
- If project-root `.env.stageserve` is missing, assumes defaults for the current run and writes a starter project file for later edits.
- Is the explicit command for bringing an additional repo into the managed set.
- Bootstraps the shared routing layer if it is not already running.
- Starts a second isolated per-project runtime and refreshes the hostname-aware shared routing rules.

### `stage down`

- Stops only the current project runtime by default.
- Keeps the project recorded as `down` after shutdown so guided and direct resume paths can offer restart or re-attach behavior.
- Removes the generated runtime envfile after shutdown.
- Repoints the shared gateway to another attached project when one exists, otherwise leaves the gateway on a no-route response.
- Supports `stage down --all` for global teardown.

### `stage detach`

- Stops tracking the current project in StageServe.
- Removes the project record and generated runtime envfile after shutdown.
- Clears the local route without touching project files or `.env.stageserve`.

### `stage status`

- Reports tracked projects from the state directory.
- Supports `--project <selector>` where selector may be a project slug, project name, hostname, or repo path.
- Shows attachment state, hostname, live service containers, and registry drift for the selected project.
- Supports `--all` to report every recorded project.

### `stage logs`

- Follows logs for the current project runtime by default.
- Supports `--project <selector>` to target another recorded project by slug, project name, hostname, or repo path.
- Accepts either a positional service name such as `stage logs apache` or `--service apache`. The default service is `nginx`.

### `stage dns-setup`

- Writes stack-managed `dnsmasq` config for the chosen suffix.
- Starts or restarts Homebrew `dnsmasq` on the configured local port.
- Installs or instructs the user to install the matching `/etc/resolver/<suffix>` file.
- Operator-facing examples should prefer `--site-suffix develop` unless a test or migration case specifically needs another allowed suffix.
- Browser access should use a full URL such as `http://my-project.develop/`; some browser address bars treat a bare hostname as a search query.
- Fails with a clear message when Homebrew is missing, `dnsmasq` is not installed, privileges are needed for `/etc/resolver`, or the resulting DNS health check is not ready.

## Onboarding Command Contract

### `stage setup`

- Runs an ordered set of machine-readiness steps: Docker CLI, Docker daemon, state directory, port 80, port 443, local DNS resolver, and mkcert local CA.
- Each step returns a `StepResult` with `id`, `label`, `status` (ready | needs_action | error), `message`, and optional `remediation`.
- Exit codes: 0 = all ready, 1 = needs_action, 2 = error, 3 = unsupported-os (highest precedence).
- `--suffix` accepts: `develop`, `dev`, `test`, or empty (stack default). Invalid values are rejected with an error.
- `--json` emits a `CommandResult` JSON envelope and suppresses interactive output.
- `--notui` and `--cli` force plain-text output for the current invocation.
- `--non-interactive` suppresses prompts and uses plain-text output.
- Does not mutate machine state on its own — flags state that is not ready and provides `remediation` strings.

### `stage doctor`

- Read-only diagnostics reusing the same readiness steps as `setup`.
- Runs Docker binary, Docker daemon, state directory, port 80/443, DNS, and mkcert checks.
- Does not attempt repairs or prompt for elevated privileges.
- Exit codes follow the same 0-1-2-3 convention as `setup`.
- `--json`, `--notui`, `--cli`, and `--non-interactive` flags behave the same as `setup`.

### `stage init`

- Writes a starter `.env.stageserve` in the project root (or `--project-dir`).
- In an interactive terminal with the default output mode, opens the guided project-config form and preview before writing anything.
- When `.env.stageserve` already exists, interactive `stage init` switches to the same guided editor but requires explicit confirmation before updating the file.
- Validates that the project root exists.
- Validates `--docroot` is inside the project root when supplied.
- The current validation is containment-only. `stage init` previews and writes a docroot path inside the project directory, but it does not require that path to already exist on disk before the write.
- Without `--force`, skips writing if `.env.stageserve` already exists.
- With `--force`, overwrites the existing file.
- `--site-name` sets `STAGESERVE_SITE_NAME` in the generated file.
- `--json`, `--notui`, `--cli`, and `--non-interactive` flags behave the same as `setup` and keep `stage init` automation-safe.
- Emits a `CommandResult` envelope (step `init.env_file`) with action in the message.

### Output modes

All three onboarding commands resolve output mode using the same precedence:

1. `--json` → JSON envelope (exit code still conveys overall status)
2. `--notui` or `--cli` → plain text
3. `--non-interactive` or `STAGESERVE_NO_TUI=1` → plain text
4. TTY auto-detect → TUI on TTY, text otherwise

### CommandResult envelope (JSON)

```json
{
  "overall_status": "ready|needs_action|error",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "docker.binary",
      "label": "Docker CLI",
      "status": "ready",
      "message": "docker found at /usr/local/bin/docker",
      "remediation": null,
      "code": "",
      "meta": null
    }
  ],
  "result": null,
  "next_steps": []
}
```

## Removed Wrappers

Root-level `20i-*` wrappers are not part of the active runtime. Use `stage <subcommand>`.

## Config Precedence

1. CLI flags
2. Project `.env.stageserve`
3. Shell environment
4. Stack `.env.stageserve`
5. Built-in defaults

Location defines ownership for the shared filename:

- `<project>/.env.stageserve` is the user-editable project override surface.
- `<stack-home>/.env.stageserve` is the stack-owned shared baseline.
- `<stack-home>/.stageserve-state/envfiles/*.env` is machine-generated runtime material and must not be edited.

Shared gateway settings are runtime-owned and no longer part of the supported env contract.

`STAGESERVE_STACK` is the explicit stack-kind selector in the env contract. The current runtime supports `20i` only; future values such as `laravel` or `node` must not be accepted until their stack implementations exist.

Selecting a different installed StageServe copy remains outside the project file for now. Use `STACK_HOME` or `--stack-home` until a dedicated project install/setup flow exists.

## Hostname Derivation

- Default source: project folder name
- Override source: `SITE_NAME`
- Full override: `SITE_HOSTNAME`
- Default suffix: `.test`
- `.dev` uses HTTPS on port `8443` by default and requires `mkcert` (`brew install mkcert && mkcert -install`); `stage up` and `stage attach` refresh the shared gateway certificate bundle when `.dev` is active.

## Document Root Contract

- `DOCROOT` is the preferred project override.
- `CODE_DIR` remains an alias for `DOCROOT`.
- Default behavior is `public_html` when present, otherwise the project root.
- The current 20i-style container layout mounts the whole repo at `/home/sites/<project-slug>`.
- The effective container docroot becomes `/home/sites/<project-slug>/<docroot-relative-path>`.
- For the current implementation, `DOCROOT` must resolve inside the project directory.

## Project State Model

- `attached`: runtime is intended to be active and recorded in state
- `down`: runtime is stopped but still recorded so StageServe can offer restart, attach, status, and removal paths
- global teardown: all known runtimes are stopped and their project records are retained as `down`

## Error Model

Every operator-facing failure from a lifecycle command is a typed `StepError` containing the failing step name, the affected project slug, the underlying cause, and a remediation hint. The CLI renders these as:

```
step <name> failed for project <slug>: <cause>
  next: <remediation>
```

The lifecycle layer rolls back partial progress before returning. A failed `stage up` never leaves a half-attached project: the state file is not written, any compose-up that completed is reversed, and any route written before the failure is removed from the regenerated shared gateway config.

## Runtime Identity Mapping

- Project slug defaults to the repo folder name, unless `SITE_NAME` overrides it.
- Compose project defaults to `stage-<slug>`.
- Runtime network is `<compose-project>-runtime`.
- Database volume is `<compose-project>-db-data`.
- Web alias on the shared network is `<compose-project>-web`.
- Planned hostname defaults to `<slug>.test` unless overridden.
- State records keep the repo path, slug, compose project, hostname, and docroot together so live Docker resources can be mapped back to the originating repo.

## State Storage

- Location: `<stack-home>/.stageserve-state/projects/<slug>.json`
- One JSON file per project, schema-versioned.
- Stores resolved runtime identity, container path layout, published per-project service ports, and recorded live container identity.
- Atomic writes (temp file + `os.Rename`) so a crash mid-write never leaves a half-formed file.
- The stack registry is computed in-memory from the JSON files; there is no positional `registry.tsv`.
- Obsolete `.20i-state` and Bash `.env` state files are ignored by default.

## Shared Infrastructure

- Shared routing compose file: `stacks/20i/docker-compose.shared.yml`
- Active 20i project compose file: `stacks/20i/docker-compose.20i.yml`
- Static stack definitions are bundled under `stacks/<kind>/` and selected programmatically via `STAGESERVE_STACK`; the catalog carries stack capabilities, requirements, and compatibility constraints while mutable runtime state remains under `.stageserve-state`.
- StageServe keeps one shared routing layer available across attached projects and repairs it when the layer is missing or unhealthy.
- Shared gateway host ports: `80/443` by default; `.dev` runtime resolution moves HTTPS to `8443` when needed
- `.dev` routing uses `platform/tls` to refresh a mkcert bundle under `<state-dir>/shared/certs` and passes `SHARED_GATEWAY_CERTS_DIR` to the shared compose file.
- Per-project web containers no longer publish host ports directly for normal site access
- phpMyAdmin runs only when the `debug` compose profile is enabled (`stage up --profile debug`); it still publishes its own host port when active
- MariaDB remains per project and resolves database name, user, password, and root password from the project-specific runtime config
- All long-running services (nginx, apache/PHP-FPM, MariaDB) declare Docker `HEALTHCHECK` directives. `stage up` waits until they report healthy before returning success; the default deadline is 120 s, overrideable via `--wait-timeout` or `STAGESERVE_WAIT_TIMEOUT`. On timeout the error names the unhealthy services.
- Gateway config is generated from the in-memory registry as one server block per attached hostname (rendered by `infra/gateway` via `text/template`; output is golden-tested)
- Invalid registry rows are skipped during route generation so one bad registration does not invalidate the full gateway config
- When a hostname is registered but its runtime is unavailable, the gateway returns a clear `503` response for that hostname

Exact shared resource names remain part of the lower-level workflow contract and troubleshooting material; ordinary operator workflows should treat the shared routing layer as StageServe-managed.

## Local DNS

- First implementation target: macOS
- Provider: Homebrew `dnsmasq`
- Listen address: `127.0.0.1`
- Listen port: `53535`
- Resolver file: `/etc/resolver/test` by default
- Setup and doctor report DNS readiness separately from Docker and port readiness
- Missing Homebrew, missing `dnsmasq`, missing resolver privileges, resolver mismatch, and stopped service are surfaced as explicit named codes (`brew-missing`, `dnsmasq-missing`, `resolver-missing`, `resolver-mismatch`, `dnsmasq-stopped`, `config-missing`)
- On Linux, `stage dns-setup` returns the named `unsupported-os` code rather than silently no-op’ing

## Port Allocation

- The first project on a fresh stack gets the canonical pair `MYSQL_PORT=3306` / `PMA_PORT=8081`.
- Subsequent projects scan upward (3307+, 8082+) avoiding ports already reserved by another slug in the registry.
- Bind-checks are performed before any compose action runs.
- Concurrent `stage up` invocations are serialised via an exclusive `flock` on `<state-dir>/.port-allocation.lock`, so two parallel runs never claim the same port.
- An explicit per-project port (`MYSQL_PORT=`/`PMA_PORT=` or `--mysql-port`/`--pma-port`) that conflicts with the registry fails fast with `step allocate-ports failed ... next: free the conflicting port or pass --mysql-port / --pma-port`.

## Phase Boundary

This contract now includes registry-driven hostname-aware gateway rules plus the first macOS local DNS bootstrap path. The `.test` hostname is the routing target at the gateway layer, and `dnsmasq` plus `/etc/resolver` provide the resolution path for that suffix.

## Phase 0: runtime baseline

## Current 20i topology

The product-owned assets are:

- `stacks/20i/docker-compose.shared.yml`: one shared `nginx` gateway on the
  external `stage-shared` network, publishing host HTTP/HTTPS ports and
  mounting generated configuration and certificates.
- `stacks/20i/docker-compose.20i.yml`: project services `nginx`, `apache`, and
  `mariadb`, plus optional `phpmyadmin` under the `debug` profile.
- `docker/nginx.conf.tmpl`: project web routing template.
- `docker/apache/Dockerfile`: PHP/Apache image build input.

The project services use two network scopes:

1. A project network named from `PROJECT_RUNTIME_NETWORK` for application and
   database communication.
2. The external shared gateway network for project `nginx` and the gateway.

The normal dependency graph is:

```text
mariadb --healthy -> apache --healthy -> nginx --healthy -> gateway route
     \-------------------- phpmyadmin (debug) ----------------/
```

The gateway must not be made dependent on the database. `phpmyadmin` is
optional and is never part of the default happy path.

## Product guarantees

These behaviors belong above the runtime adapter and must remain stable across
backends:

| Area | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | A project is identified by StageServe slug/path/state, not a vendor container ID. |
| Start | `stage up` is idempotent and leaves a registered project attached only after health and route checks pass. |
| Stop | `stage down` stops only the selected project and updates state; volume deletion is explicit. |
| Rollback | Failure after project startup cleans up the partially started project and does not leave a false attached record. |
| Ports | Conflicts are detected before runtime creation; allocated project ports remain associated with the project. |
| Routing | A healthy project is reachable through its configured hostname and gateway route. |
| Health | Startup does not complete while required services are unhealthy or missing. |
| Status | Desired state, observed state, missing services, unhealthy services, and drift are distinguishable. |
| Logs | An operator can retrieve/follow logs for a named service with a useful missing-service error. |
| Exec | A supported one-shot command runs in the selected service and returns output plus failure status. |
| Persistence | Database data survives stop/start; explicit volume removal is destructive and separate. |
| Cleanup | Repeated up/down cycles do not leak runtime resources, generated env files, or gateway routes. |
| Errors | Operator-facing failures identify the failed step and a concrete next action. |

## Docker-specific implementation details

These details are not portable guarantees and must stay inside the Docker
adapter:

- `docker compose` is the orchestration command surface.
- `com.docker.compose.project`, `com.docker.compose.service`, and
  `io.stageserve.*` labels are the observation mechanism.
- Docker container IDs are recorded in `state.RuntimeIdentity` as observations.
- Compose `depends_on` health conditions provide startup ordering.
- The Docker Engine SDK supplies network existence, labeled listing, health
  polling, logs, and exec.
- Compose profiles implement the optional `debug` service.

## Apple backend minimum profile

The first Apple profile should support only the guarantees it can prove:

- Apple silicon and macOS 26 host.
- OCI image pull/build/run.
- Stable StageServe-generated service names.
- Host-published ports or inspected direct container addresses.
- Source bind mounts and named database volumes.
- Explicit health probes, logs, exec, stop, delete, and inspection.
- A tested network/DNS strategy for gateway-to-project traffic.

The Apple profile must report unsupported rather than emulate silently when it
needs any of the following unproven behaviors:

- Compose-style dependency orchestration.
- Bare service-name discovery on a custom network.
- Docker Engine API/socket consumers.
- Docker-specific profiles, labels, or volume semantics.
- Cross-backend shared gateway routing.

## Capability matrix

The machine-readable baseline is
`infra/runtime/testdata/capability-matrix.json`. It intentionally separates
product guarantees from backend capabilities. A backend can be selected only
for a stack profile whose required capabilities are all supported and tested.

## Phase 0 evidence

The existing tests in `core/lifecycle/orchestrator_test.go`,
`observability/status/status_test.go`, `core/config/loader_test.go`, and
`core/state/store_test.go` characterize the current short-test behavior. Before
the Apple adapter is added, extend that coverage when a missing product
guarantee is discovered; do not weaken an existing Docker assertion to fit the
new backend.
