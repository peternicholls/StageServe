> **Historical planning:** Superseded on 2026-09-11 by the [Apple-only roadmap](roadmap.md) and [spec 012](../specs/012-apple-only-experience/spec.md). Retained as evidence; unchecked or checked items below are not the current backlog.

# Recommended Roadmap Task List

Date: 2026-05-22
Plan: [Recommended Roadmap Implementation Plan](recommended-roadmap-plan.md)
Source: [Project Analysis Report](project-analysis-report.md)

## Format

- `[P]` means the task can usually run in parallel with nearby tasks if files do not overlap.
- Validation tasks are deliverables and should be updated with command output or notes when run.
- If a task is intentionally deferred, move it to a deferred section with the reason.

## Phase 1: Contract Reconciliation

**Goal**: Make active code, command help, docs, and specs agree before adding guided behavior.

### Contract Decisions

- [x] T001 Decide whether `status --project <selector>` remains active contract or docs are corrected to current-only/`--all` behavior. Decision: keep and implement `--project` for recorded project selectors.
- [x] T002 Decide whether `logs` should accept positional service names, keep only `--service`, or support both. Decision: support both, with a conflict error when they disagree.
- [x] T003 Decide whether `setup --recheck` should be implemented or removed from active docs. Decision: remove from active docs because setup has no cache to bypass.
- [x] T004 Decide whether `doctor` owns shared-gateway checks or active docs should stop claiming that behavior. Decision: active docs/help now describe the implemented read-only readiness scope.
- [x] T005 Decide whether `setup` is check-only or guided repair/mutation, then update remediation language accordingly. Decision: setup remains check-only; DNS remediation points to `stage dns-setup --site-suffix <suffix>`.
- [x] T006 Decide final output-mode flag shape for active code: spec 007 `--notui`/`--cli` versus current `--tui`/`--no-tui`. Decision: expose `--notui` and `--cli`; keep legacy `--no-tui` hidden for compatibility; remove exposed `--tui`.
- [x] T007 Decide whether `.dev` TLS is fully supported now or explicitly partial/deferred. Decision: keep active and wire lifecycle TLS generation/mounting.
- [x] T008 Decide whether `--profile debug` remains supported or is removed from active surfaces until wired. Decision: keep and wire `debug` into project compose up.
- [x] T008b Decide which cleanup items from the analysis report are release-blocking versus tracked follow-up work. Decision: Phase 1 release blockers were command/docs contract drift, late rollback route cleanup, debug profile wiring, and `.dev` TLS wiring; root flag architecture cleanup remains follow-up.

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] T009 Add or correct `--project <selector>` support for `status` in [cmd/stage/commands/status.go](../cmd/stage/commands/status.go), or remove it from [README.md](../README.md) and [docs/runtime-contract.md](runtime-contract.md).
- [x] T010 Add shared project selector resolution for `status` and `logs` if T001 keeps the selector contract.
- [x] T011 Add positional service support to [cmd/stage/commands/logs.go](../cmd/stage/commands/logs.go), or correct README examples to `stage logs --service apache`.
- [x] T012 Implement or remove `setup --recheck` across [cmd/stage/commands/setup.go](../cmd/stage/commands/setup.go), [docs/runtime-contract.md](runtime-contract.md), and tests.
- [x] T013 Implement gateway diagnostics in [cmd/stage/commands/doctor.go](../cmd/stage/commands/doctor.go), or correct active docs/specs to the implemented readiness scope.
- [x] T014 Fix DNS readiness remediation so a DNS bootstrap blocker points to `stage dns-setup --site-suffix <suffix>` or the decided setup repair flow.
- [x] T015 Update setup/help/README/runtime copy so `setup` mutation behavior is described consistently.
- [x] T016 Implement final no-TUI flag aliases or clean up docs/help to match the current output-mode contract.
- [x] T017 Wire `--profile debug` through lifecycle compose `UpOptions`, or remove the flag/docs until supported.
- [x] T017b Update command `Short` and `Long` text touched by reconciliation so help prefers StageServe user goals over Docker/gateway internals.
- [x] T018 Add route cleanup after late `stage up` failures in [core/lifecycle/orchestrator.go](../core/lifecycle/orchestrator.go).
- [x] T019 Add lifecycle tests proving failed state save or post-route failure does not leave a stale gateway route.
- [x] T020 If `.dev` TLS remains active, wire mkcert generation through [platform/tls](../platform/tls), pass `SHARED_GATEWAY_CERTS_DIR`, and preserve TLS settings when adding routes.
- [x] T021 If `.dev` TLS is deferred, update [README.md](../README.md), [docs/runtime-contract.md](runtime-contract.md), and `.env.stageserve.example` to mark it partial. Not applicable: `.dev` TLS remains active and T020 was implemented.
- [x] T022 Reconcile spec 004 and spec 007 task checkboxes with implemented reality; keep open gaps explicit.
- [x] T023 Add docs/code drift checks for known mismatch patterns: `--project`, `--recheck`, `stage logs apache`, `--tui`, and `--no-tui`.
- [x] T023a Add a command-help contract check that compares documented examples against `stage <command> --help` for non-mutating paths.

### Phase 1 Validation

- [x] T024 Run `go test ./cmd/stage/commands ./core/lifecycle ./observability/status ./infra/gateway`.
- [x] T025 Run `go test -short ./...`.
- [x] T026 Run `go vet ./...`.
- [x] T027 Run `go build ./...`.
- [x] T028 Run `git diff --check`.
- [x] T029 Capture `stage --help`, `stage setup --help`, `stage status --help`, and `stage logs --help` evidence after reconciliation.

### Phase 1 Deferred

- [ ] T008a/T017a Root-level shared flag cleanup is deferred to Phase 4 T078f because moving config, lifecycle, and selector flags to command-local ownership is broader command architecture work. Phase 1 help-copy expectations were updated for the active flags touched here.

### Phase 1 Validation Evidence

- 2026-05-22: `go test ./cmd/stage/commands ./core/lifecycle ./observability/status ./infra/gateway` passed.
- 2026-05-22: `go test -short ./...` passed.
- 2026-05-22: `go vet ./...` passed.
- 2026-05-22: `go build ./...` passed.
- 2026-05-22: `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-05-22: `go run ./cmd/stage --help`, `go run ./cmd/stage setup --help`, `go run ./cmd/stage status --help`, and `go run ./cmd/stage logs --help` captured from source. Evidence showed `setup` exposes `--notui`/`--cli` without exposed `--tui`/`--no-tui`, `status` exposes `--project`, and `logs` exposes `[service]`, `--project`, and `--service`.

## Phase 2: Guided Foundation

**Goal**: Add the non-UI planner and root routing needed for bare `stage` guided behavior.

### Planner Foundation

- [x] T030 [P] Create `core/guidance/types.go` with TUI capability, guided context, next action plan, action, visible defaults, warnings, and direct command equivalents.
- [x] T031 [P] Create `core/guidance/context.go` with cheap context collection and injected seams for config, state, readiness, and status checks.
- [x] T032 Implement `core/guidance/planner.go` for `machine_not_ready`, `project_missing_config`, `project_ready_to_run`, `project_running`, `project_down`, `drift_detected`, `not_project`, and `unknown_error`.
- [x] T033 Add `core/guidance` tests for pure planner decisions and no-mutation context collection.
- [x] T034 Add a terminal-verifiable planner inspection path or debug command that does not mutate project config or state. Bare `stage` now renders the planner's text fallback without writing project config or state.

### Root Routing

- [x] T035 Add injectable terminal/mode detection for root interaction in [cmd/stage/commands](../cmd/stage/commands).
- [x] T036 Add root no-args `RunE` in [cmd/stage/commands/root.go](../cmd/stage/commands/root.go).
- [x] T037 Implement non-TTY text fallback rendering for `core/guidance.NextActionPlan`.
- [x] T038 Implement `STAGESERVE_NO_TUI=1`, `--notui`, and `--cli` handling for bare `stage`.
- [x] T039 Ensure `stage --help` and direct subcommands bypass guided routing.
- [x] T040 Keep JSON output modes free of guided copy.
- [x] T040a Honor `NO_COLOR=1` in text fallback and any projected output that would otherwise use color.

### Phase 2 Validation

- [x] T041 Run `go test ./core/guidance ./cmd/stage/commands`.
- [x] T042 Verify bare `stage` in a real TTY opens the guided path or initial guided shell.
- [x] T043 Verify `stage > /tmp/stage-guidance.txt` exits without prompting.
- [x] T044 Verify `STAGESERVE_NO_TUI=1 stage` uses text fallback.
- [x] T045 Verify `stage --notui` and `stage --cli` use text fallback.
- [x] T046 Verify `stage --help` and `stage up --help` remain direct help paths.
- [x] T046a Verify `NO_COLOR=1 stage --notui` or equivalent captured output contains no color styling.

### Phase 2 Validation Evidence

- 2026-05-22: `go test ./core/guidance ./cmd/stage/commands` passed.
- 2026-05-22: `go run ./cmd/stage` rendered the initial guided text shell.
- 2026-05-22: `go run ./cmd/stage > /tmp/stage-guidance.txt` exited and wrote plain guidance without prompting.
- 2026-05-22: `STAGESERVE_NO_TUI=1 go run ./cmd/stage` used text fallback.
- 2026-05-22: `go run ./cmd/stage --notui` and `go run ./cmd/stage --cli` used text fallback.
- 2026-05-22: `go run ./cmd/stage --help` and `go run ./cmd/stage up --help` stayed on direct help paths.
- 2026-05-22: `NO_COLOR=1 go run ./cmd/stage --notui` captured no ANSI styling.

## Phase 3: Guided First-Run And Day-2 Actions

**Goal**: Make guided mode useful for setup, project initialization, running, status, logs, stopping, and recovery.

### First-Run Flow

- [x] T047 Build the first guided TUI shell with status header, decision bar, tool work panel, details view, and persistent footer.
- [x] T048 Route setup checks through existing onboarding result semantics.
- [x] T049 Implement guided project config preview using the shared project-env model.
- [x] T050 Add confirmation before writing `.env.stageserve`.
- [x] T051 Add inline editing for project name, web folder, and local suffix/address preview.
- [x] T052 Recompute the planner after config creation and offer the next safe action.
- [x] T052a Make `stage init` open the guided project-config form by default in interactive terminals.
- [x] T052b Keep `stage init --notui`, `stage init --cli`, `stage init --json`, and non-TTY `stage init` non-guided and automation-safe.

### Day-2 Flow

- [x] T053 Route guided run/add actions through existing `up` and `attach` lifecycle semantics.
- [x] T054 Route guided status through existing status reporting.
- [x] T055 Route guided logs through existing logs behavior with a clear exit path.
- [x] T056 Route guided stop actions through `down` and removal through `detach`, each with explicit confirmation.
- [x] T056a Clarify or wrap shared-gateway reload output after `stage down` so Docker Compose's internal `up` output is not mistaken for a project restart.
- [x] T057 Route diagnostics/recovery through doctor/readiness/status seams without exposing `doctor` as a first-level peer action.
- [x] T058 Order recovery actions from least invasive to most invasive and rerun planning after each step.
- [x] T059 Ensure primary guided labels use user-goal language before command terminology.
- [x] T060 Ensure running-project default actions are non-destructive.

### Documentation And Evidence

- [x] T061 Update [README.md](../README.md) first-run path to start with bare `stage` after implementation lands.
- [x] T062 Update [docs/runtime-contract.md](runtime-contract.md) for guided root behavior, no-TUI controls, text fallback, and direct command behavior.
- [x] T063 Add or restore an active installer/onboarding doc if still referenced by specs.
- [x] T064 Record terminal validation evidence in [archive/2026-09-11-pre-apple-only/specs/007-harden-TUI-and-other-interactions/quickstart.md](../archive/2026-09-11-pre-apple-only/specs/007-harden-TUI-and-other-interactions/quickstart.md).
- [x] T064a Update [install.sh](../install.sh) so interactive install handoff points to bare `stage` after guided routing lands, while non-interactive installs keep explicit commands.
- [x] T064b Update [.env.stageserve.example](../.env.stageserve.example) comments for guided config creation and active TLS/setup decisions.
- [x] T064c Update command `Short` and `Long` strings for guided surfaces so first-level help uses plain user-goal language.

### Phase 3 Validation

- [x] T065 Validate bare `stage` from a project without `.env.stageserve`.
- [x] T066 Validate cancel-before-write leaves no `.env.stageserve` file.
- [x] T067 Validate bare `stage` from a configured project after `stage down` cleanup.
- [x] T068 Validate bare `stage` from a running project.
- [x] T069 Validate logs action exits cleanly.
- [x] T070 Validate stop/overwrite/recovery confirmations.
- [x] T071 Validate text fallback parity with the guided situation and default action.
- [x] T072 Run `go test ./core/guidance ./core/onboarding ./cmd/stage/commands ./core/config ./core/lifecycle ./observability/status ./infra/gateway`.

### Phase 3 Progress Evidence

- 2026-05-23: `go test ./core/guidance ./core/onboarding ./cmd/stage/commands` passed after T051/T052a/T052b.
- 2026-05-24: `go test ./cmd/stage/commands ./core/guidance ./core/lifecycle ./observability/status ./infra/gateway` passed after T053.
- 2026-05-24: `go test ./core/guidance ./cmd/stage/commands ./core/lifecycle` passed after guided day-2 status/logs/recovery actions, explicit stop/remove confirmations, retained `down` records, and `stage detach` landed.
- 2026-05-24: `go test -short ./...` passed.
- 2026-05-24: `go vet ./...` passed.
- 2026-05-24: `go build ./...` passed.
- 2026-05-28: README first-run guidance, the runtime contract, `.env.stageserve.example`, and a new active [docs/installer-onboarding.md](installer-onboarding.md) were updated to start from bare `stage` and document the direct-command fallback.
- 2026-05-28: `go run ./cmd/stage --help`, `go run ./cmd/stage init --help`, `go run ./cmd/stage setup --help`, and `go run ./cmd/stage doctor --help` confirmed plain-language first-level help after the guided-surface copy pass.
- 2026-05-28: installer smoke runs with `STAGESERVE_TEST_ASSET_PATH=/bin/echo` showed the interactive handoff prints `stage` and the non-interactive path prints `stage setup`, `stage init`, `stage up`, and `stage doctor`.
- 2026-05-28: `go test ./core/guidance ./core/onboarding ./cmd/stage/commands ./core/config ./core/lifecycle ./observability/status ./infra/gateway` passed.
- 2026-05-28: `go run ./cmd/stage --stack-home /tmp/stageserve-guided-stack --project-dir /tmp/stageserve-guided-missing` in a TTY showed the missing-config guided screen with `Create project settings`, previewed the local URL, and did not write project files before confirmation.
- 2026-05-28: disposable guided runs for `/tmp/stageserve-guided-missing` and `/tmp/stageserve-guided-cancel` left `.env.stageserve` absent when the session exited before any confirmed write.
- 2026-05-28: `go run ./cmd/stage --stack-home /tmp/stageserve-guided-stack --project-dir /tmp/stageserve-guided-missing --notui` matched the same missing-config situation, key facts, and default action in plain text.
- 2026-05-28: with `STACK_HOME` set to the repo checkout and `STAGESERVE_STATE_DIR=/tmp/stageserve-live-state`, a disposable live project was created under `/tmp/stageserve-live-project`; `go run ./cmd/stage down --project-dir /tmp/stageserve-live-project` followed by bare `stage` showed the retained stopped-project screen with `Run this project again` and exited through an `expect` script with `expect_exit=0`.
- 2026-05-28: the same disposable live project, while running, showed the guided running-project screen with `View project logs` as the default action; the guided logs path exited back to the main screen and the scripted session returned cleanly with `expect_exit=0`.
- 2026-05-28: live guided stop confirmation was validated on the running disposable project: the confirmation copy matched `StageServe will stop this project.` and `Your files will not be touched.`, cancel returned `No changes made.`, and the `expect` session exited 0.
- 2026-05-28: interactive `go run ./cmd/stage init --project-dir /tmp/stageserve-live-project` on an existing `.env.stageserve` showed the guided overwrite flow with `Update project settings`; its confirmation copy matched the no-runtime-change contract, cancel returned `No changes made.`, and the `expect` session exited 0.
- 2026-05-28: `go test ./core/guidance ./cmd/stage/commands` passed after adding focused coverage for the drift recovery stop confirmation and the guided `stage init` overwrite flow.

## Phase 4: Guided TUI Design Polish

**Goal**: Once guided flows are stable, tighten formatting, layout, colour, and component consistency so the TUI makes fuller use of the Charm stack without changing the interaction contract.

### Design And Implementation

- [x] T072a [P] Audit guided screens against `docs/design/terminal-visual-style-guide.md` and the active terminal instruction set; record intended deltas before polishing code.
- [x] T072b Extract or refine reusable Bubble Tea/Lip Gloss helpers for guided headers, facts rows, decision rows, confirmations, details, and footer hints.
- [x] T072c Apply a spacing, alignment, and hierarchy pass to guided screens in `cmd/stage/commands/tui.go` and any shared render helpers they use.
- [x] T072d Apply a semantic colour/emphasis pass for guided screens while preserving `NO_COLOR` behavior and text fallback parity.
- [x] T072e Validate narrower-width and multi-state guided renders (details, confirmation, editing, long-running result) and record any deliberate deferrals.
- [x] T072f Record terminal design evidence in `archive/2026-09-11-pre-apple-only/specs/007-harden-TUI-and-other-interactions/quickstart.md` or the active design review surface.

### Phase 4 Progress Evidence

- 2026-05-28: audited the guided shell against `docs/design/terminal-visual-style-guide.md`, the guided flow map, and the terminal instruction set; the concrete deltas were to name the active surface in the header, make setup and recovery checklists the dominant section, and add semantic emphasis without changing action copy or text fallback.
- 2026-05-28: `core/guidance/shell.go` now routes the guided renderer through shared helpers for surface headers, key facts, decision rows, work panels, details, and footer hints; setup and recovery screens now render their checklist before the choice list, and narrow renders stack key facts below 58 columns instead of forcing padded inline rows.
- 2026-05-28: semantic verdict and section-title styling now distinguish ready, warning, and recovery surfaces while preserving `NO_COLOR` behavior; the deliberate deferral for this slice is that very long path/value rows still rely on terminal wrapping rather than a dedicated truncation or viewport treatment.
- 2026-05-28: `go test ./core/guidance ./cmd/stage/commands` passed after adding deterministic coverage for project, recovery, and 48-column guided renders.

## Post-Phase 4: Code review, cleanup, and release prep
- [ ] T072g Follow instructions and planning in [archive/2026-09-11-pre-apple-only/specs/011-guided-experience-and-runtime-hardening](../archive/2026-09-11-pre-apple-only/specs/011-guided-experience-and-runtime-hardening) to prepare for release, including code review, cleanup, and release notes drafting.

## Phase 5: Process Hardening

**Goal**: Strengthen validation, documentation architecture, and release workflow.

### Integration And Smoke Tests

- [ ] T073 Add a tagged integration test or script for single-project `up/status/logs/down`.
- [ ] T074 Add a tagged integration test or script for two-project `up/attach/status/project-down/down --all`.
- [ ] T075 Add integration coverage for failed `STAGESERVE_POST_UP_COMMAND` rollback.
- [ ] T076 Add integration coverage for `--profile debug` phpMyAdmin activation, or remove the feature from active contract.
- [ ] T077 Add integration coverage for `.dev` TLS, or record an explicit skipped/deferred case.
- [ ] T078 Add release smoke checks for installer asset naming, checksum verification, install handoff, and `stage --version`.

### Architecture Cleanup

- [ ] T078a Consolidate onboarding projection switching in `setup`, `doctor`, and `init` into one shared helper, or record why it is deferred.
- [ ] T078b Replace duplicate setup/doctor/init silent exit-code error types with one shared implementation.
- [ ] T078c Consolidate `.env.stageserve` rendering rules for `stage init`, first `stage up`, first `stage attach`, and guided previews into one shared model.
- [ ] T078d Address the dead `Detach` branch in [infra/compose/compose.go](../infra/compose/compose.go) by honoring the option or removing it from `UpOptions`.
- [ ] T078e Split non-flow helpers out of [core/lifecycle/orchestrator.go](../core/lifecycle/orchestrator.go) where doing so clarifies ownership without changing behavior, or create follow-up tasks for the split.
- [ ] T078f Review [cmd/stage/commands/root.go](../cmd/stage/commands/root.go) after guided routing lands and move any remaining command-specific flags off the root command.

### Extensible Stack Registry Planning

- [ ] T078g Decide the ownership split between the shipped stack catalog in `stacks/<kind>/` and any future user-defined stack registry; keep runtime state under `.stageserve-state` out of scope for user-authored definitions.
- [ ] T078h Design the first user-owned custom stack manifest format and storage location under stack home, including override/preference rules relative to built-in stack kinds.
- [ ] T078i Decide whether the first custom stack registry should be file-backed or SQLite-backed; default to file-backed unless the required mutation/query workflow clearly justifies SQLite.
- [ ] T078j Define validation, compatibility, and migration rules for custom stack manifests, including required shared services, supported profiles/suffixes, and operator-facing error reporting.

### Docs And Command Reference

- [ ] T079 Expand spec 009 from placeholder into a working documentation plan.
- [ ] T080 Restructure README around install, first run, common workflows, and troubleshooting links.
- [ ] T081 Define a user manual information architecture for setup, project config, daily work, DNS/TLS, multi-project, and recovery.
- [ ] T082 Define a command reference strategy generated from or checked against Cobra help.
- [ ] T083 Move contributor-heavy material to contributor docs.
- [ ] T084 Mark archive-only material clearly and keep historical behavior out of active user docs.

### Release And CI Alignment

- [ ] T085 Align [Makefile](../Makefile) `release` target with [.github/workflows/release.yml](../.github/workflows/release.yml), or remove the placeholder target.
- [ ] T086 Add CI or manual workflow documentation for tagged integration tests.
- [ ] T087 Add docs/command contract checks to CI if they are cheap and stable.
- [ ] T088 Record final real-daemon validation evidence before release.

### Phase 4 Validation

- [ ] T089 Run `go test -short ./...`.
- [ ] T090 Run `go vet ./...`.
- [ ] T091 Run `go build ./...`.
- [ ] T092 Run tagged integration suite on a Docker-capable machine.
- [ ] T093 Run installer/release smoke checks.
- [ ] T094 Run `git diff --check`.
- [ ] T094a Run Markdown/link sanity checks for active docs touched by the roadmap.

## Final Roadmap Gate

- [ ] T095 Confirm active docs, command help, specs, and tests agree on the supported product surface.
- [ ] T096 Confirm bare `stage` guided behavior is validated in TTY, non-TTY, disabled-TUI, and direct-command modes.
- [ ] T097 Confirm single-project and multi-project runtime claims have real-daemon evidence.
- [ ] T098 Confirm release and install paths are documented and tested.
- [ ] T099 Move unresolved items into explicit deferred follow-up specs with rationale.
- [ ] T100 Confirm analysis-report cleanup findings are resolved, deferred, or represented by follow-up tasks.
